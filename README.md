# bitwm
An X window manager based on binary space partitioning and dynamic tagging.
Bitwm is very incomplete, and should not be used for anything ever. It is not icccm compliant, can't shift windows offscreen, is not at all configurable, and doesn't come with build instructions or a dependancy list.
But it does tile windows.
