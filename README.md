# bitwm
A dynamic, manually tiled, binary tree based X window manager.
Based on a binary space partitioning concept similar to that of bspwm, and tagging of awesome wm.
It is currently very experimental, and is missing some slightly important things (like icccm compliance, or any ability to shift windows off screen).
